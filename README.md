# Image-Generation-Using-GANs-Experiment-on-MNIST
About : This repository showcases a deep learning project aimed at creating synthetic handwritten digit images through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Autoencoders. The experiments are carried out on the widely used MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9.

Project Overview
This repository presents a machine learning project centered on producing synthetic handwritten digits through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Autoencoders. The experiments are carried out on the MNIST dataset, which provides grayscale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9.

Project Goals

•	Implement GANs to synthesize realistic handwritten digit samples.

•	Apply VAEs to learn and generate meaningful latent representations of digits.

•	Explore Autoencoders for tasks such as data compression and reconstruction of digit images.

•	Conduct a comparison of the performance of these generative models on the MNIST dataset.
