# Image-Generation-Using-GANs-Experiment-on-MNIST
About This repository showcases a deep learning project aimed at creating synthetic handwritten digit images through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Autoencoders. The experiments are carried out on the widely used MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9.
